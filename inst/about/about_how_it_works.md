## Why bother with any data preparation?

This Shiny application is designed to do as little as it needs to:

- Load in some prepared data
- Filter according to the user's wishes
- Display the results
- Produce data downloads

This allows for a fast, lightweight, and easy-to-maintain Shiny application without any loss in functionality.

What you see in this Shiny app are cleaned and optimised datasets that ~we~ an automated pipeline prepared earlier.
What you don't see is that preparation, and it goes a little like this.
